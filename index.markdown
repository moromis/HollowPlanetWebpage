# Chapter 1
### A Beginning

A strand of brown hair tangled and spun as it floated in midair. The length of hair glinted copper as it caught the sun's unfiltered rays and reflected them, bouncing against the thick glass and scattering the color brilliantly. The brown wisp matted against the glass, spreading a thin spider's leg of moisture as the deep cold of the glass met the relative warmth of the hair and condensate formed. The girl's face, which the strand of hair was indirectly attached to, slowly crept up to the glass till its nose smooshed into the wall and imprinted a greasy print on the otherwise austere surface.

Segre let out a bated breath and peered down her nose as the transparent wall blossomed with fog. Her eyes crept back up and stared out at the surface of the planet. There was a single tractor hauling several trailers trundling along, far off in the distance. Between Segre and the tractor there lay a slithering, low stream of gray-brown water, which slowly coursed from left to right. Closer still, there were boulders and smaller rocks, all of the metamorphic variety, and between these and Segre's outlook was a ten-foot wide patch of dust which hovered millimeters off a perfectly flat layer of hard-packed, pitch-black earth beneath.
